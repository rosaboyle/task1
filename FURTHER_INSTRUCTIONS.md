### Security Instructions

#### Protecting Sensitive Information:
1. **Do Not Store Secret Keys in Repositories:**
   - **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store secret keys and other sensitive information. This ensures that they are not hard-coded into your source code.
   - **Configuration Files:** Store sensitive information in configuration files that are not tracked by version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude these files from being committed to the repository.
   - **Secrets Management Tools:** Utilize secrets management tools such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information.

2. **Use `.gitignore` Effectively:**
   - Add sensitive files and directories to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being tracked by Git. Examples include configuration files, environment files, and any other files containing sensitive information.

3. **Review Commits Before Pushing:**
   - Always review your commits before pushing them to the repository to ensure that no sensitive information is included.

4. **Use Encrypted Communication:**
   - Ensure that all communication with your repository (e.g., Git operations) is done over encrypted channels (e.g., HTTPS or SSH).

5. **Regularly Rotate Keys and Secrets:**
   - Regularly rotate your keys and secrets to minimize the risk of them being compromised.

6. **Access Control:**
   - Limit access to your repositories to only those who need it. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions effectively.
